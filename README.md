### Project Description
This project is a website that integrates both a Dogstore and Veterinary Consultation services, providing pet owners with a one-stop solution to shop for high-quality dog products and access veterinary care remotely. The platform allows users to browse a wide range of dog food, grooming supplies, and accessories, as well as schedule virtual consultations with certified veterinarians for any health concerns regarding their pets.

### The Problem statement
Pet owners often struggle to manage the health and needs of their dogs through multiple platforms or physical visits. They face the challenge of accessing both pet products and veterinary consultations without spending extra time navigating different websites or locations. This fragmentation creates inconvenience, especially for busy pet owners who need easy access to products and expert advice for their dogs.

### The Solution
We built a comprehensive website that combines dog product shopping with easy access to veterinary consultations. This unified platform ensures pet owners have everything they need‚Äîwhether it's a product or professional health advice‚Äîall in one place, making it more efficient and convenient for them to care for their dogs.
